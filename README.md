# we

This aims to be a game about the transmission of knowledge.

Usually RTS games are based on gathering resources, building, and upgrading entities, most times when certain quantity of resources _enable it_. Probably these improvements will never be lost.

Along history, on the other hand, there have been plenty of great people who made greater discoveries and inventions and decided to share them with others. 

Then, We -the game- tries another point of view: what is not transmitted between generations may be lost. In the times of oral lore, what was not learned could'nt be teached, so it vanished through time.
